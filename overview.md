# Overview
## Features
I plan on implementing the following features (will be âœ” [checked off] when implemented):
- Cards
- Columns
- Tags
- Color coding
- Reports (Time spent, tasks per day, pomodoros...)
- Time logging (Pomodoro, stopwatch, and manual)
- Canvas integration (Import tasks from Canvas)
- Automatic time estimate from similar tasks (can be disabled or overriden)
- Calendar view of due dates
## Tech Stack
I will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep it simple.
